# redis

Redis image mirror from https://hub.docker.com/_/redis

cf. Github repository: https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/redis

Hosted on GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) to avoid DockerHub pull limitations, and easily deploy on clusters (such as Kubernetes).

# Automatically updated

The image on ghcr.io is automatically updated every week (Monday at 4:00 GMT+1) by a GitHub Actions workflow to match the latest tag of Redis
